## Building
Make sure to have node package manager (npm) installed, along with yarn.

```brew cask install node```
```npm install -g yarn```

As a sidenote, to get started with a new project:
```yarn parcel init```

I installed packages by doing:

```cd (project dir)```

```yarn parcel add --dev```

```yarn parcel add p5```

```yarn parcel add --dev @types/p5```

Yarn automatically installs dependecies like TypeScript and Sass. It detects it via files in the directory.

In order to run the server, just do:

```yarn parcel```
